# classic-cars

## Description

This project highlights classic cars with a unique menu interaction that rotates the page to display the navigation. The two galleries stand out as one has a hover effect that plays and pauses the video and the other gallery is placed on a 3D shelf. With those galleries, I learned about video mute and loop, and that perspective doesn't work the same on all browsers. For the full 3D effect in the Image Gallery open in Safari.
